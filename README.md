# Unexpected Behavior of `calc()` with Percentages and Pixels

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur when using the CSS `calc()` function with a mix of percentages and fixed units (like pixels).  The problem arises when the parent element's width isn't explicitly set or is dynamically calculated.

## The Problem

The `calc(50% - 10px)` expression might seem simple, but it can produce unexpected results.  The browser evaluates the percentage first, then subtracts the pixels.  If the parent's width changes or isn't defined, the calculation becomes inaccurate, potentially causing layout issues.

## Solution

The best solution is to ensure the parent element has a defined width.  If dynamic sizing is necessary, consider using a more robust approach that doesn't rely on `calc()` with percentages in this way, or explore alternative layout techniques like flexbox or grid.
