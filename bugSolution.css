The solution involves ensuring the parent element has an explicitly defined width. Here's how you can modify the CSS to fix this:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Explicit width for the parent */
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

By providing a fixed width to the parent element, the browser can accurately compute the 50% and the subtraction, yielding the expected result for the child element.  Alternatively, if the parent's width must remain dynamic, consider avoiding mixing percentages and fixed units within `calc()` or using a different layout method like flexbox or grid which handle dynamic sizing more gracefully.
